INNER JOIN -> 

EVERY TABLES SHOULD MUST HAVE SOME DATA
IF NOT THEN IT'LL NOT SHOW THE DATA IT'LL 
FILTER ALL THOSE VALUES AND WILL CUT THEM 
FROM RESULT.

LEFT JOIN ->

IF SUPPOSE IN BETWEEN THE TABLES FOR A 
PARTICULAR DATA THERE IS NO DATA AVAILABLE
THEN ALSO IT'LL SHOW THE DATA AS NULL THAT
BASICALLY MEANS THAT THE OUTPUT SHOULD BE 
GIVEN 100% IN CASE OF INNER JOIN IT'LL NOT
SHOW THE DATA SUPPOSE IF THERE IS NO DATA AVAILABLE BUT HERE IN LEFT JOIN IF DATA IS
NOT AVAILABLE THEN ALSO IT'LL BE SHOWN AS 
NULL.

RIGHT JOIN --> 

SWAP THE TABLES.
